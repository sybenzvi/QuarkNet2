Hi Kevin

The uC code ver 3.4 should be okay.  No changes have been made in any of the data handling routines. 
I am attaching the altera cpld binary rbf files that we looked at in July.  The new boards Dave is 
sending will be loaded with (qnettst-dec.rbf 07-22-04 sumcheck=6AEE  (DS COUNTS OK)) that allows DS 
counts after the 'CD' command.  The 'FR' command will show the sumcheck.  I will try to track down 
the source files.

qnettst.rbf     01-14-05 sumcheck=5FBD  (NO DS COUNTS)
qnettst-dec.rbf 07-22-04 sumcheck=6AEE  (DS COUNTS OK)

;   01-12-05  - Ver 3.3 New CMD 'U1' shows uC gps_uart1 rec char errors
;   01-12-05  - Ver 3.3 Added overrun check on GPS NMEA msg rec size for buffer overrun
;   04-01-06  - Ver 3.4 Added option to return scalar data line at the Status line output time. (cmd 
'ST 2')
