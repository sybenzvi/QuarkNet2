Hello Aaron,

OK, so I sat down with Terry Kiper at FNAL and he reminded me of all
this.  Here's the story.

The output you get when you reset documents the microcode version.
Nominally we want v3.4, but anything v3.2 or above should be fine.  The
microcode must be flashed with a special tool.

There is also a programmable logic device (CPLD) that implements most of
the interface with the serial port and display features on the board.
The way to figure out what version we are running is to issue a "RF"
command.  We want boards which report "6AEE".  This is code that we can
upload locally with only a small risk of failing.

So please check all of our boards for non "6AEE" units as well.

Thanks!
Kevin
