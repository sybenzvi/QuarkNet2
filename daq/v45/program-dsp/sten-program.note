Subject: Re: program for the muon boards

Hi Kevin:
	To load the new file, I would use a terminal emulator such as
hyperterm. To prepare the board for load type "WF 0" which means load code
from the serial port into page 0 of the flash rom. Then use the ascii file
transfer portion of the terminal emulator to send the attached file to the
board. In the particular case of hyperterm the menu says "send text
file". When the board loads everything OK, you should see "Flash Load Complete"
as a message. You will need to reset the board to load the new flash code
into the DSP RAM. If the message says "Flash Load Error", try loading
again, but don't reset. That will load bad code into the DSP ram and the
only thing you can do at that point is bring it here so we can externally
program the flash.
	As to the board response to doubles, it should be as you say. The
second hit must come from only one counter, but it can be either counter.
You can use the status register contents to see which if the counters
caused the second hit.


				Cheers,

					Sten.
